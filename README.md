# C++ Calculator Project

This repository contains two C++ calculator programs:

1. **Basic Calculator**: A simple calculator supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.
2. **Scientific Calculator**: A more advanced calculator supporting operations like power, square root, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and factorials.

## Features

### Basic Calculator:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)

### Scientific Calculator:
- Power (x^y)
- Square Root (âˆšx)
- Logarithm (ln)
- Logarithm (log10)
- Exponential (e^x)
- Trigonometric Functions: Sine (sin), Cosine (cos), Tangent (tan)
- Factorial (n!)

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or clang++)
- Standard C++ library (No external dependencies)

## How to Use

### Basic Calculator:
1. Download and compile the `basic_calculator.cpp` file.
2. Run the program and choose your desired operation by entering the corresponding number or symbol.
3. The calculator will prompt you to input two numbers and will show the result.

### Scientific Calculator:
1. Download and compile the `scientific_calculator.cpp` file.
2. Run the program and select the operation you want to perform.
3. The calculator will prompt you for input and display the result.

## Example:

```bash
$ g++ basic_calculator.cpp -o basic_calculator
$ ./basic_calculator
